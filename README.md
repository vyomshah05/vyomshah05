## <img src="assets/vario_move.gif" alt="Vario Move" width="50" height="50"> Hi there 👋

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at UC Irvine with a strong focus on software engineering, machine learning, and systems. I’ve worked across backend development, distributed systems, and applied AI, building production-ready software through internships and research.

My interests include scalable system design, ML-driven applications, and building tools that turn complex data into reliable, real-world solutions.
